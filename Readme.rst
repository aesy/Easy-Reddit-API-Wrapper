Easy Reddit API Wrapper
=======================
A API Wrapper around the `Reddit OAuth 2 API <http://www.reddit.com/dev/api/oauth>`_ based on Jonathan LeBlancs' `Reddit PHP SDK <https://github.com/jcleblanc/reddit-php-sdk>`_. This project has as of yet not been properly tested. Feel free to try it out, but I would advise against using it in production.
